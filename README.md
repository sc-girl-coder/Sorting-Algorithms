# Sorting-Algorithms
 Program will create a randomly generated array of a number of elements  that the user enters and display the first 20 values of that array.  Then the program will use recursion and sequentially search the array for some  value. The program will then use selection, insertion and 3 pivot values for quick  sort and compare the time it takes for each as well as how many comparisons were  done to get to that value.
